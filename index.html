<p>I started my blog in 2012.</p>
<br>
<p>Since then we have got some degree of notice.</p>
<br>
<p>Even a celebrity has read our blog!</p>
<br>
<p>I travel all around the world trying new foods and blog them.</p>
<br>
    <h2> About Me! </h2>

    <!--6) Replace this with a picture of youself-->
    <img src = "me.jpg" height = "200px" width = "200px">
    <p>I was born in India and all of my family originates from there.</p>
    <br>
    <p>That is why I have a deep connection with Indian food.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I know how to cook Indian food to some extent.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Indian food has always been my favorite and a comfort food.</p>
    <br>
  <h2>Indian Foods</h2>
      <!--9) Replace the pictures in the table with ones that make sense-->
      <!--Remember to re-size them so the fit nicely in the table-->
    <table>
     <tr>
      <td><img src = "Food1.jpg"  height = 200 width = 200></td>
      <td><img src = "Food2.jpg"  height = 200 width = 200></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td><img src = "Food3.jpg"  height = 200 width = 200></td>
      <td><img src = "Food4.jpeg"  height = 200 width = 200></td>
     </tr>
    </table>
    <p> The top row is Paneer and Dosa respectively.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Both are one of my favorites and I would definitley recomend.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The bottom row is naan and Idli respectively.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I would reccomend these too but don't eat naan plain always get a side dish like paneer.</p>
